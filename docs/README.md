### 4. Configure menu structure

#### Auto sidebar

You may choose to display the sidebar, but have it populated automatically from headings on a single HTML file - the homepage (_docs/README.md_). This is the way that this project's own docs site is setup.

This solution is great if you are happy to move all your doc content into a **single** markdown file, as it means not having to worry about manually updating a navigation bar when you docs change. Especially if you have a many files to manage or they are likely to change in name or structure.

To setup auto sidebar:

1. Delete *_sidebar.md*.
2. Open _index.html_ to edit it.
3. Set `loadSidebar: false` and save.

Warning: If you go for this option without a configured sidebar, do not leave any links in your _docs/README.md_ which refer to other doc files. Although the link may be valid, once you click on the link, the sidebar on that page will reflect the target page rather than the outline of the _docs/README.md_ page, which is inconsistent and jarring behavior.

#### Custom sidebar

You can choose to configure a custom sidebar. This is necessary to link to the multiple doc files.

##### Guidelines

How to setup a sidebar file:

- The format should be bullet points in markdown format.
- Each menu item should be a markdown link e.g. `[Name](link)`. An item may exist on the menu without a link - this is useful for grouping items together under a menu heading.
- The links must be follow restrictions noted above in [Linking to pages](#linking-to-pages). If the doc files change (e.g. are renamed or moved), you need to remember to update the sidebar config.
- The bullet points may optionally be nested, using indentation. You may create arbitrary indentation in your sidebar, even if all you files are at the same level in the _docs_ directory.

Example:

[_sidebar.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-template/master/nested_example/_sidebar.md ':include :type=code')

##### Setup custom sidebar

1. Ensure `loadSidebar: true` is set in the _index.html_ file.
    - The value of `true` means `*_sidebar.md*` will be referenced by the app.
    - The sidebar is already enabled in the quickstart [index.html](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-template/blob/master/quickstart/index.html).
2. Edit the *_sidebar.md* file.
3. Add items using the guidelines above.

##### Note on Home link

The clickable text above the standard sidebar takes you to the cover page. You can scroll down to the homepage (_docs/README.md_), but there are no links on the page to the homepage. So add a link to the homepage with the first entry above. Note: An alternative is to use the nav bar config for Home button, rather than sidebar config.

```
- [Home](/#my-app)
```

NB. The leading forward slash is **required** here for correct behavior. As the anchor tag will be invalid on other pages such as `foo.md` which has path `/#/foo/`).

The link is a reference to an anchor tag on the root URL, where anchor tag refers the ID of the homepage heading element. This ID will be created by _Docsify_. To find it, go to the coverpage, scroll down to the homepage and click on the heading. The URL will be something like `http://localhost:3000/#/?id=my-app`. The part we want is the end e.g. `my-app`.

This is really the text of heading element, which has been made lowercase and hyphenated. Copy this to the sidebar file and prefix it with a hash symbol.

### 5. Configure cover page

The cover page is the first page that a visitor sees before scrolling down to the homepage.

If you want to use it, edit your *docs/_coverpage.md* file and complete the `TODO` items. You can also use this project's [cover page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelCurrin/docsify-template/master/docs/_coverpage.md) on Github as a reference.

You can add additional buttons to the bottom of the homepage, but there should be no gaps between the lines in your file. And the last one will be solid while the others will be transparent.

The _Docsify_ site explains how to set a background image or color [here](https://docsify.js.org/#/cover?id=custom-background). A background image should come _after_ the buttons in your file, as _Docsify_ looks for an image there then uses CSS to place the image behind the content and give it faded grey look.

You can delete the cover page and disable it in _index.html_.

#### Image

You could include an image (logo, photo) above your project title. For example, you could do this if you have a file in a *docs/_media* directory.

```
![icon](_media/logo.svg)
```

### 6. Configure Style

Edit _index.html_.

#### 6.1 Color

Optionally set a theme color. This affects how some content looks, such as quoted blocks, underlined text and buttons. This will default to theme's default if not set manually. i.e. green for _Vue_ and blue for _Buble_.

```js
window.$docsify = {
  themeColor: '#3F51B5',
};
```

More on Docsify [theme color](https://docsify.js.org/#/configuration?id=themecolor).

#### 6.2 Themes

Find the style which is set in the `<head>` tag, which looks like this.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/docsify/lib/themes/<THEME>">
```

Replace the end of URL with one of these four themes:

- `vue.css`
- `buble.css`
- `dark.css`
- `pure.css`

You can optionally remove `/lib` from the theme URL to get the _uncompressed_ CSS file.

Read more on the _Docsify_ [themes](https://docsify.js.org/#/themes?id=themes) guide.

Note: The _Buble_ theme has sidebar headings which are not distinguished from the sub items. Therefore you can add this to _index.html_ to get bold headings similar. Based on _vue.css_.

```html
<style>
    .sidebar .sidebar-nav>ul>li {
        font-weight: 700;
        margin: 0;
    }
</style>
```

### 7. Advanced configuration

The configuration steps above already get you a prettier and more usable site in my opinion than the barebones one which the _Docsify_ `init` command or their _Quickstart_ guide gives you. This section covers advanced steps - you may skip these and jump straight to the [Github Pages](#setup-github-pages-site) section.

#### App configuration

You can update the config parameters passed in on the _index.html_ page. There are some useful things there in like adjusting the sidebar levels, putting a logo in the sidebar or setting your root _README.md_ as your homepage. There is even a search bar you can add.

For available parameters, these are documented on the _Docsify_ [Configuration](https://docsify.js.org/#/configuration) page.

For defaults - see _Docsify_ [config.js](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/blob/develop/src/core/config.js) script.

See some values below which are worth considering for the siderbar.

```js
window.$docsify = {
  // Maximum Table of Contents (TOC) level. Default value shown here.
  maxLevel: 6,

  // Add table of contents (TOC) in custom sidebar. Default value shown here. Try a value of 2.
  subMaxLevel: 0,

  logo: '/_media/icon.svg',

  name: 'docsify'
}
```

Change the homepage. These recommendations come from the docs.

```js
window.$docsify = {
  // Change to /home.md
  homepage: 'home.md',

  // Or use the readme in your repo
  homepage: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsifyjs/docsify/master/README.md'
};
```

#### Plugins

Highlights from the [List of Plugins](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins?id=list-of-plugins) on the _Docsify_ site.
- [External script](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins?id=external-script) - If the script on the page is an external one (imports a js file via src attribute), you'll need this plugin to make it work.
- [Google Analytics](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins?id=google-analytics) - Add tracking.
- [Tabs](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins?id=tabs) - A docsify.js plugin for displaying tabbed content from markdown.

Also of interest:
- For pulling in JSON data and not just markdown files:
    - [bandorko/docsify-variables](https://github.com/bandorko/docsify-variables)
    - [kissybnts/docsify-json-variables](https://github.com/kissybnts/docsify-json-variables) or on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docsify-json-variables)

#### Favicon

Optionally customize _index.html_ to point to a custom _favicon_, if you added one.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="_media/favicon.ico">
```

## Setup Github Pages site

If you followed the steps above, you'll have a locally running docs site.

Now, commit and push the files to Github.

Next, edit your repo's setting on Github. Select the option to serve the `docs` directory of the `master` branch as Github Pages site. When you refresh the settings page, then you will see a link to your site there.

Open the link in the browser.


## Write content

This section deals with how to update and add to the content of your doc files.

### Embed

You can embed content such as video, audio, iframes (`.html`), code blocks or even Markdown files.

#### Format

Add the `':include'` parameter in a markdown URL reference. Here is the format:

```markdown
[filename](url ':include')
```

The URL could be a local file (e.g. `_media/foo.js`) or a remote URL `https://...`.

If you want to embed a code block, you can use the automatic formatting. But markdown and HTML files need to be marked as a code if you want them as code rather than HTML.

```
':include :type=code'
```

See the _Docsify_ [Embed](https://docsify.js.org/#/embed-files) help for forcing types and using fragments.

#### Examples

#### Render markdown

Render markdown as HTML.

```markdown
[example.md](https://docsify.js.org/_media/example.md ':include')
```

[example.md](https://docsify.js.org/_media/example.md ':include')

Note: The result is _not_ inside a code block expected. It is inside a quote block because the source content starts with `> `.

#### JS snippet

Auto formatted.

```markdown
[example.js](_media/example.js ':include' )
```

[example.js](_media/example.js ':include' )

#### Markdown snippet

Force to code snippet.

```markdown
[_sidebar.md](_coverpage.md ':include :type=code')
```

[_sidebar.md](_coverpage.md ':include :type=code')

#### Warnings

- Do not put the URL in a bullet point as it will become an ordinary link.
- Do not put two embed items in a sequence without some characters in between, otherwise you will get a JS error rending the page. Putting an empty line between them is **not** sufficient.
- If you embed a URL of a Github file, remember to use the _Raw_ URL otherwise you will get an error.


## Docsify CLI

_Docsify_ also provides a convenient but optional CLI. It helps you create and serve a Docsify project. In particular, it provides hot reloading by default when using the server - an open localhost webpage will refresh when project files are saved.

### Setup

```bash
$ npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Links for installing and using the CLI.

- [Docsify Quickstart](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on _Docsify_ homepage.
- [Docsify CLI](https://docsifyjs.github.io/docsify-cli) project's docs.

### Commands

#### init

> Creates new docs

Setup an initial _README.md_ (duplicated from project root), _index.html_ and _.nojekyll_ in your a target directory. If you don't want the CLI to do it for you, you can create the files by hand or use this project's _quickstart_ directory to get you going.

e.g.

```bash
$ docsify init docs
```

#### serve

> Run local server to preview site.

Serve the target directory as a docs site locally. This includes hot reload, to refresh the page on file changes. See [serve](#21-serve) options above.

e.g.

```bash
$ docsify serve docs
```

Serves as [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), or a different port if there is already a _Docsify_ server running.

#### start

> Server for SSR

This command is for Server-Side Rendering. I haven't tried this yet.

## Static site vs SPA

### Server side rendering

Although SEO crawlers can do better at sites like single page application, _Docsify_ is still said not to be SEO-friendly, compared with static sites where all HTML is pre-rendered.

However, _Docsify_ provides the option of pre-rendering all the views as static HTML. This can improve SEO.

See [Server-Side Rendering](https://docsify.js.org/#/ssr) section of the _Docsify_ docs.

### Why not use a static site generator?

_Docsify_ is a SPA, not a static-site generator.

_Jekyll_ and _Hugo_ are excellent options for static site generators. They can use themes suited to documentation and they can build off of a _docs_ directory. If you want to read more about those, see my [resources](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/static-sites-generator-resources) project.

These are just tools to build a site. What is appropriate depends on your usecase, how much you need to customized the site and how much effort you want to spend on installing/running/maintaining the project.

I find _Docsify_ light to add to a project and to use for new projects. So it is a great fit for me.

A static site generator can be heavy to setup and manage.

There are dependencies to manage - they might have to be upgraded if their are security vulnerabilities or they are no longer available. Such as plugins and themes for _Jekyll_. And plugins for _Hugo_. Plus you probably need a couple of _JavaScript_ or _CSS_ files that either you or a theme added. Such as _Query_. This _Docsify_ project only needs exactly one _JavaScript_ and one _CSS_ file.

There is HTML to build locally and on the remote. While _Docsify_ needs no dependencies to serve a site, _Jekyll_ sites needs `jekyll` installed and _Hugo_ sites need `hugo` available.

A static site needs to to customize it in depth or setup a theme which also takes effort. You may lose or gain functionality when switching between Jekyll themes because they use their own templates and layouts.

You probably have to add _front matter_ to your doc files so they can inherit from layouts and have the correct metadata like title.

As with _Docsify_, you will probably have to create a config file which covers the structure of your project for use in the sidebar.

Unlike building static files with HTML, with with Docsify there is a single page application running off of a _index.html_ - on each request, a markdown file is fetched by the client and rendered as HTML with a theme and menu. The performance will depend more on the server when serving static HTML pages (prebuild and serve page on the client) or on the client when using a single page application (build structure on the client).

Also, the _Docsify_ approach will only work if _JavaScript_ is enabled.

The _Docsify_ site says it supports back to Internet Explorer 11, so that at least helps for a wider audience of users.
