#### JS snippet

Auto formatted.

```markdown
[example.js](_media/example.js ':include' )
```

[example.js](_media/example.js ':include' )

#### Markdown snippet

Force to code snippet.

```markdown
[_sidebar.md](_coverpage.md ':include :type=code')
```

[_sidebar.md](_coverpage.md ':include :type=code')

#### Warnings

- Do not put the URL in a bullet point as it will become an ordinary link.
- Do not put two embed items in a sequence without some characters in between, otherwise you will get a JS error rending the page. Putting an empty line between them is **not** sufficient.
- If you embed a URL of a Github file, remember to use the _Raw_ URL otherwise you will get an error.


## Docsify CLI

_Docsify_ also provides a convenient but optional CLI. It helps you create and serve a Docsify project. In particular, it provides hot reloading by default when using the server - an open localhost webpage will refresh when project files are saved.

### Setup

```bash
$ npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Links for installing and using the CLI.

- [Docsify Quickstart](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on _Docsify_ homepage.
- [Docsify CLI](https://docsifyjs.github.io/docsify-cli) project's docs.

### Commands

#### init

> Creates new docs

Setup an initial _README.md_ (duplicated from project root), _index.html_ and _.nojekyll_ in your a target directory. If you don't want the CLI to do it for you, you can create the files by hand or use this project's _quickstart_ directory to get you going.

e.g.

```bash
$ docsify init docs
```

#### serve

> Run local server to preview site.

Serve the target directory as a docs site locally. This includes hot reload, to refresh the page on file changes. See [serve](#21-serve) options above.

e.g.

```bash
$ docsify serve docs
```

Serves as [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), or a different port if there is already a _Docsify_ server running.

#### start

> Server for SSR

This command is for Server-Side Rendering. I haven't tried this yet.

## Static site vs SPA

### Server side rendering

Although SEO crawlers can do better at sites like single page application, _Docsify_ is still said not to be SEO-friendly, compared with static sites where all HTML is pre-rendered.

However, _Docsify_ provides the option of pre-rendering all the views as static HTML. This can improve SEO.

See [Server-Side Rendering](https://docsify.js.org/#/ssr) section of the _Docsify_ docs.

### Why not use a static site generator?

_Docsify_ is a SPA, not a static-site generator.

_Jekyll_ and _Hugo_ are excellent options for static site generators. They can use themes suited to documentation and they can build off of a _docs_ directory. If you want to read more about those, see my [resources](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/static-sites-generator-resources) project.

These are just tools to build a site. What is appropriate depends on your usecase, how much you need to customized the site and how much effort you want to spend on installing/running/maintaining the project.

I find _Docsify_ light to add to a project and to use for new projects. So it is a great fit for me.

A static site generator can be heavy to setup and manage.

There are dependencies to manage - they might have to be upgraded if their are security vulnerabilities or they are no longer available. Such as plugins and themes for _Jekyll_. And plugins for _Hugo_. Plus you probably need a couple of _JavaScript_ or _CSS_ files that either you or a theme added. Such as _Query_. This _Docsify_ project only needs exactly one _JavaScript_ and one _CSS_ file.

There is HTML to build locally and on the remote. While _Docsify_ needs no dependencies to serve a site, _Jekyll_ sites needs `jekyll` installed and _Hugo_ sites need `hugo` available.

A static site needs to to customize it in depth or setup a theme which also takes effort. You may lose or gain functionality when switching between Jekyll themes because they use their own templates and layouts.

You probably have to add _front matter_ to your doc files so they can inherit from layouts and have the correct metadata like title.

As with _Docsify_, you will probably have to create a config file which covers the structure of your project for use in the sidebar.

Unlike building static files with HTML, with with Docsify there is a single page application running off of a _index.html_ - on each request, a markdown file is fetched by the client and rendered as HTML with a theme and menu. The performance will depend more on the server when serving static HTML pages (prebuild and serve page on the client) or on the client when using a single page application (build structure on the client).

Also, the _Docsify_ approach will only work if _JavaScript_ is enabled.

The _Docsify_ site says it supports back to Internet Explorer 11, so that at least helps for a wider audience of users.
